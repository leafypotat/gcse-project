A dice rollling game for a project I had to do for GCSE CompSci

Rules:
- 2 players
- Each turn 2 dice are rolled
- If the combined total of the two dice is even, then you gain 10 points + the total of the dice roll
- If this is odd, you earn the total of the two dice - 5, unless that would put you in negative points where you would gain/lose nothing
- Rolling a double allowed you to roll another

-  After 5 rounds, the player with the highest score wins. Their name and score is added to a text file.
-  If it's a tie, whoever rolls the greatest value die wins
